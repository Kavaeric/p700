            <h1>Faster-than-light travel</h1>
            <p><strong>Faster-than-light travel</strong> (abbreviated as “FTL travel”) is a method of transit that allows a
vehicle to travel faster than the universal speed limit, permitting rapid travel between long
distances in space that could otherwise take centuries or even millennia.</p>

<h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>
<p>In relativistic space, the maximum speed achievable is denoted by the the constant <sr>c</sr>,
approximately 299,792,458 metres per second.</p>

<p>Although it may seem fast, distances in space are massive: At this speed, it would take nearly three
centuries to travel the 2721m (287.7ly) between <a href="Sol.html">Sol</a> and <a href="Koa.html">Koa</a>. By using an FTL
device known as an FTL drive, this limit can be side-stepped to travel galactic distances.</p>

<p>Two systems of FTL drive exist: The <a href="Warp_drive.html">warp drive</a> and the
<a href="Quantum_drive.html">quantum drive</a>. Strictly speaking, however, neither systems are
faster-than-light drives per se. Instead, both designs seek to bypass this limitation; in the case
of the warp drive, to simply alter spacetime itself; in the case of the the quantum drive, to find
alternate routes to complete journeys faster than in relativistic space; Neither system does in fact
actually result in a vehicle being transported faster than the speed of light.</p>

<h2 id="measurement">Measurement</h2>
<p>Faster-than-light speeds are measured in termen, denoted by the letter c. One termen is equivalent
to the speed of light. At even higher speeds, petametres per second (Pm/s) are used, or even
exametres per second (Em/s).</p>
