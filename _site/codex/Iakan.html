<p><strong>Iakans</strong> (colloquially referred to as “ikes”) are a <a href="Terran.html">Terran</a> model of
<a href="Aerosynth.html">aerosynth</a>. They are <a href="Synthetic.html">synthetic</a>, sapient beings.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="appearance">Appearance</h2>
<p>Iakans have a distinct triangular top-down silhouette and a relatively flat body, most notably from
their lack of vertical stabiliser fins. The primary wing surfaces are located quite far behind,
with a long neck bearing three linear sets of eyes. In plan view, their silhouette is vaguely
reminiscent to that of a swallow.</p>

</div>

<p>In standard colours, their refractive armour is a brilliant white, set atop a standard matte black
underside, while casimir drive and shield generation outlets are vermillion in colour.</p>

<h2 id="anatomy">Anatomy</h2>
<p>Their main fuselage and chassis is made of specialised piezoelectric-doped superalloys that can flex
with applied electrical charge, but remain incredibly strong otherwise. Over top the main fuselage
is a similarly doped layer of refractive armour.</p>

<p>Four limbs are mounted on the underside, two of which having a hand-thumb configuration to allow the
manipulation of smaller objects. Because of the rearward position of the hind limbs, iakans often
walk on all fours when on the ground for stability, although they are also capable of “sitting”
more upright when not stationary.</p>

<p>Depending on occupation, a <a href="Railgun.html">railgun</a> may be mounted on each forearm.</p>

<h3 id="internals">Internals</h3>
<p>Iakans run off of a number of <a href="Supercapacitor.html">supercapacitor banks</a>, which they can recharge
either through direct plug-in to an external power source, or through self-production through the
use of the their own <a href="Photovoltaic_cell.html">photovoltaic cells</a>.</p>

<p>Iakans possess three sets of <a href="Casimir_drive.html">casimir drives</a> for propulsion:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The primary set is a pair of drives located on each of the trailing edges of the iakan’s wings. These can provide up to 460 kN of thrust each.</li>
  <li>The secondary set is located at the centre-rear. The secondary set is used for cruising or orbital manoeuvring, and have an output of about a quarter of the primary set.</li>
  <li>The tertiary set is found on the belly of the iakan, and provides vertical thrust for hovering or flight assistance at low speeds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Iakans are based on <a href="Quantum_computer.html">quantum</a> hardware.</p>

<h2 id="capability">Capability</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular perception, the term “superiority fighter” does not describe iakans very
appropriately, as their standard armament of twin arm-mounted railguns is only suitable against
light armour and shields. Thusly when entering battle, an iakan must don armour and new weapons.</p>

<p>More importantly is their ability to operate in a variety of environments and circumstances,
including the ability to traverse space, albiet without a faster-than-light drive, thus requiring
the use of a <a href="Drive_vehicle.html">drive vehicle</a>. They are also capable of travel in extreme
temperatures, pressures, and humidities, including underwater and in a gas giant’s atmosphere.</p>

<p>Within a standard Earth atmosphere at low stratospheric altitude (approximately 25 kilometres, or
at 25 millibars of pressure), an iakan is capable of achieving speeds in excess of 1100 m/s (over
3960 km/h).</p>

<h2 id="progression">Progression</h2>
<p>As with any synth, iakans have to be educated and taught over the span of several years after
fabrication. Iakans in particular progress through six stages of development during maturity,
numbered 0 through V.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Iakan 0</strong>: Initial stage, iakan 0s have negligible thrust ability, no wings, nor armament. Primary education is taught, such as culture, sciences, and anatomy. Later, foundational subjects on flight are taught.</li>
  <li><strong>Iakan I</strong>: Glider stage, iakan Is are given straight training wings, a training tailfin, and some thrust capability, though not enough to achieve powered flight on their own. Instead, their primary thrusters are only able to accelerate them for brief beriods of time. Basics of flight are taught at this point.</li>
  <li><strong>Iakan II</strong>: Flight stage, iakan IIs are given powered training engines and learn to achieve powered flight, including taking off and landing.</li>
  <li><strong>Iakan III</strong>: The training tailfin is removed from iakan IIIs and replaced with the final tail nocks. Some more advanced manoeuvres are taught at this stange, including hovering.</li>
  <li><strong>Iakan IV</strong>: Training wings are removed from iakan IVs. In some cases, simulated railguns are added. All other flight skills are taught at this stage, including operation in extreme environments.</li>
  <li><strong>Iakan V</strong>: All limitations removed, full flight power and weapons capability if any.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pre-stage V iakans are often affectionately referred to as “ike tykes” by those raising them.</p>

<p>A common misconception is that iakans are military-focused aerosynths; While military enlistment is
common for many iakans, this is not legally compulsory nor prescribed on iakans from their anatomy.</p>

<p>Common occupations among iakans include exploration and surveying work, courier services,
aerobatics, military patrol and escort, and aerosport racing.</p>
