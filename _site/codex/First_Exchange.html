            <h1>First Exchange</h1>
            <p>The <strong>First Exchange</strong> was a series of communications and partnerships between
<a href="Terran.html">Terran</a> and <a href="Ikamo.html">Ikamo</a> civilisations. It is generally defined as the
period between first contact being made in 226, and first physical contact on board
<a href="Gateway_Prime.html">Gateway Prime</a> in 274.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Prior to first contact, Terrans develop <a href="Tachyon_Communicator.html">tachyon communicators</a>,
allowing faster-than-light communications by sending particles through hyperspace. On 2 June 205,
Terrans intercepted an unknown communication which would later prove to be of Ikamo origin; 
Subsequent communications were intercepted on 2 June 220 and then again on 7 September 226. Analysis
of the signal confirmed it was of artificial origin, and the source was triangulated to
<a href="Koa.html">Koa</a>.</p>

<p>In the following year of 227, the <a href="First_Contact_Tone.html">First Contact Tone</a> was relayed to the
Koa system.</p>
