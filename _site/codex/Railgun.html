            <h1>Railgun</h1>
            <p>A <strong>railgun</strong> is an electromagnetic device that accelerates projectiles with electrical current
induced by two conducting rails. While finding many applications, the term is often used to refer
exclusively the weaponised variety.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>Terran railgun weapons technology was being developed as early as the 000s century, promising to
deliver higher firepower and projectile speed than conventional chemical-propelled ballistic
weapons. <a href="Metallurgy.html">Metallurgy</a> at the time, however, had not yet advanced far enough to make
the technology practical even for heavy artillery. Thus, the rails of early prototypes would
destroy themselves from the heat and electrical current, needing to be repaired or outright
replaced after every shot.</p>

<p>Railguns were considered for the deployment of atmospheric aerosols during the
<a href="Terran_Climate_Change.html">Terran climate change</a> period of the 000s and 100s centuries, but was
scrapped in favour of dispersal from aircraft.</p>

<h2 id="dual-stage-railgun">Dual-stage railgun</h2>
<p>The dual-stage railgun (DSR) is the most common form of weaponised railgun in service today.</p>

<h3 id="round">Round</h3>
<p>A railgun round is composed of two primary layers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An ablative layer that will turn into plasma upon contact with the rail. The plasma will
act as an armature connecting the rails to the projectile.</li>
  <li>A core which will be the actual projectile delivered to the target. Special tungsten (60%) alloys
are used to combine mass as well as conductivity. Specialist rounds using different materials are
also commonplace, as are entirely different constructions, such as sabot rounds.</li>
</ul>
