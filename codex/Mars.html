<p><strong>Mars</strong> (<strong>Sol e</strong>, or <strong>Sol-IV</strong>) is the fourth planet from the type-G5V star <a href="Sol">Sol</a>.
It is the outermost terrestrial planet in the <a href="Solar_system">Solar system</a>, as well as being
the second-smallest planet in the system, behind <a href="Mercury">Mercury</a>. Mars has two natural
satellites, Phobos and Deimos, likely captured from the neighbouring <a href="Solar_asteroid_belt">asteroid belt</a>.</p>

<p>Mars was a popular topic in pre-interstellar <a href="Terran_Federation">Terran</a> culture as well as a
prospective destination for colonisation efforts, with proposals to terraform the planet not uncommon.
The invention of <a href="Faster-than-light_travel">faster-than-light travel</a>, however, afforded Terrans
the ability to almost pick and choose destinations to explore and settle. With its primary attraction,
its proximity to <a href="Earth">Earth</a>, rendered moot, Mars ultimately faded from prominence, with little
reason to visit.</p>

<p>Mars maintains a sparse, highly decentralised population. Abandoned structures of early colonisation
still litter the Martian landscape, from derelict rovers and outposts to rusted facilities initially
designed to assist with the terraforming of Mars.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Terrans colonised Mars long before the advent of interstellar travel. Due to its relative proximity
to Earth as well as its ease of habitation - especially when compared to planets such as <a href="Venus">Venus</a> - 
Mars gained prominence as a major Terran colonisation destination during the 000s century. The Martian
population peaked in 142, at about 35 million inhabitants. During this time, terraforming infrastructure
was constructed en masse on Mars, with the hopes that the planet could be turned into an Earth-like
world in the coming centuries.</p>

<p>With faster-than-light technology widespread by the mid-late 100s century, however, interest in Mars
declined as much more lucrative, habitable worlds were made accessible, and as such the prospect
of terraforming Mars became a moot point with more readily livable worlds elsewhere.</p>

<p>The <a href="Solstice_War">Solstice War</a> likely secured the fate of the declining Martian population, as
numerous pro-capitalist factions and corporations were based on Mars. Most were expelled or outright
eliminated during the closing years of the war.</p>

<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p>Mars is mostly covered in a dusty desert landscape, varying between mountain ranges, canyons, rocky
plains, sand dunes, and ice features. The planet is neither tectonically nor volcanically active,
with its mantle having cooled and mostly solidified long ago due to its much smaller size with
respect to Earth.</p>

<h2 id="atmosphere">Atmosphere</h2>
<p>With no magnetic field to protect it from solar wind, Mars has little atmosphere to speak of. The
surface pressure on Mars is approximately 6% that of standard atmosphere and pressure, equivalent to
pressure at an altitude of about 19 kilometres above sea level.</p>

<p>The Martian atmosphere is mainly composed of carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen and
argon. Oxygen makes up about 0.15% of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Dust storms are a regular occurrence on Mars, mostly happening when Mars is at its closest to Sol
in its orbit. These storms can be global, blanketing the entire planet in thick dust and obscuring
sunlight to its surface. It is important to note that, although speeds of up to 100km/h can be
achieved by these storms, the thin Martian atmosphere negates much of the intensity of the wind.</p>
