**Faster-than-light travel** (abbreviated as "FTL travel") is a method of transit that allows a
vehicle to travel faster than the universal speed limit, permitting rapid travel between long
distances in space that could otherwise take centuries or even millennia.

## Theory
In relativistic space, the maximum speed achievable is denoted by the the constant <sr>c</sr>,
approximately 299,792,458 metres per second.

Although it may seem fast, distances in space are massive: At this speed, it would take nearly three
centuries to travel the 2721m (287.7ly) between [Sol](Sol.html) and [Koa](Koa.html). By using an FTL
device known as an FTL drive, this limit can be side-stepped to travel galactic distances. 

Two systems of FTL drive exist: The [warp drive](Warp_drive.html) and the
[quantum drive](Quantum_drive.html). Strictly speaking, however, neither systems are
faster-than-light drives per se. Instead, both designs seek to bypass this limitation; in the case
of the warp drive, to simply alter spacetime itself; in the case of the the quantum drive, to find
alternate routes to complete journeys faster than in relativistic space; Neither system does in fact
actually result in a vehicle being transported faster than the speed of light.

## Measurement
Faster-than-light speeds are measured in termen, denoted by the letter c. One termen is equivalent
to the speed of light. At even higher speeds, petametres per second (Pm/s) are used, or even
exametres per second (Em/s).
