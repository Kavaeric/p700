The **Anthropocene calendar** is the predominant calendar system used by the
[Terran Federation](Terran_Federation.html). It is heavily based off of the older Gregorian
calendar, with its only difference being its definition of year zero as the beggining of Terran
agriculture.

The anthropocene calendar uses years roughly equivalent to the orbital period of [Earth](Earth.html)
around [Sol](Sol.html). Each year is divided into 12 months of alternating 30 to 31 days, with
the second month of February being 28 days long, resulting in a typical year lasting 365 Earth days.
Because an actual Earth orbit lasts for 365.2422 days, however, the calendar designates certain
years as leap years that add an extra day to February, making it 29 days long.
