The **First Exchange** was a series of communications and partnerships between
[Terran](Terran.html) and [Ikamo](Ikamo.html) civilisations. It is generally defined as the
period between first contact being made in 226, and first physical contact on board
[Gateway Prime](Gateway_Prime.html) in 274.

## Background

Prior to first contact, Terrans develop [tachyon communicators](Tachyon_Communicator.html),
allowing faster-than-light communications by sending particles through hyperspace. On 2 June 205,
Terrans intercepted an unknown communication which would later prove to be of Ikamo origin; 
Subsequent communications were intercepted on 2 June 220 and then again on 7 September 226. Analysis
of the signal confirmed it was of artificial origin, and the source was triangulated to
[Koa](Koa.html).

In the following year of 227, the [First Contact Tone](First_Contact_Tone.html) was relayed to the
Koa system.
