The **Solstice War** (the **Chorale War**, or the **Terran Civil War**) was a
[Terran](Terran_Federation.html) conflict that lasted from 12E 368 to 12E 507. The war followed the
banning of competing parties from the [Terran Union](Terran_Union.html) parliament, and ultimately
ended with its dissolution, with Terran space fracturing into multiple warring factions for well
over a century, until the capture of [Geneva](Geneva.html) in 507 and the subsequent formation of
the modern [Terran Federation](Terran_Federation.html).

## Background
First contact and the following [First Exchange](First_Exchange.html) with the
[Ikamo](Ikamo_Federation.html) led to the successful development of the
[quantum drive](Quantum_drive.html), a [faster-than-light](Faster-than-light_travel.html)
transportation system that allowed spacecraft to travel much faster than those equipped with an
older [warp drive](Warp_drive.html) system. The discovery of abundant [antimatter](Antimatter.html)
in [hyperspace](Hyperspace.html) also sparked a gold rush from Terran corporations as well as the
then-Terran government, the [Terran Union](Terran_Union.html).

Private corporations quickly began aggressively pushing development of hyperspace travel and
[antimatter trawling](Antimatter.html#trawling) technologies, while simultaneously receiving
financial incentives from the Terran Union for their continued expansion into space and development
of antimatter trawling and quantum drive technology.
