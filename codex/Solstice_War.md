The **Solstice War** (the **Chorale War**, or the **Terran Civil War**) was a
[Terran](Terran_Federation.html) conflict that lasted from 12E 368 to 12E 507. The war followed the
banning of competing parties from the [Terran Union](Terran_Union.html) parliament, and ultimately
ended with its dissolution, with Terran space fracturing into multiple warring factions for well
over a century, until the capture of [Geneva](Geneva.html) in 507 and the subsequent formation of
the modern [Terran Federation](Terran_Federation.html).

## Background
First contact and the following [First Exchange](First_Exchange.html) with the
[Ikamo](Ikamo_Federation.html) led to the successful development of the
[quantum drive](Quantum_drive.html), a [faster-than-light](Faster-than-light_travel.html)
transportation system that allowed spacecraft to travel much faster than those equipped with an
older [warp drive](Warp_drive.html) system. The discovery of abundant [antimatter](Antimatter.html)
in [hyperspace](Hyperspace.html) also sparked a metaphorical gold rush from Terran corporations, backed
by the then-Terran government, the [Terran Union](Terran_Union.html).

Private corporations quickly began aggressively pushing development of hyperspace travel and
[antimatter trawling](Antimatter.html#trawling) technologies, while simultaneously receiving
financial incentives from the Terran Union for their continued expansion into space and development
of antimatter trawling and quantum drive technology.

Over time the Terran Union became highly dependent on trawling corporations, allowing these companies
to expand their enterprises with little oversight. Most corporations also took advantage of the scale
of space to operate, with many relocating their businesses off [Earth](Earth.html) or even outside
the [Solar system](Solar_system.html) entirely, evading what little regulation was in place already.

### Criticism and gradual backlash
By the 300s the wealth gap had widened considerably; exact statistics are still unclear, with most 
estimates placing the GINI coefficient of the Terran Union as a whole anywhere between 50% and 70%,
with some as high as 84%.
