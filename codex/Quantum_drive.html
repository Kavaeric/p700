            <h1>Quantum drive</h1>
            <p>A <strong>quantum drive</strong> (<strong>hyperspace drive</strong>, or <strong>hyperdrive</strong>) is a device that allows a vehicle to
enter and exit <a href="Hyperspace">hyperspace</a>. It is used to achieve <a href="Faster-than-light_travel">faster-than-light travel</a>.
Since its widespread adoption following the <a href="First_Exchange">First Exchange</a> in the 200s and 300s
century, it has complimented the older <a href="Warp_drive">warp drive</a> in allowing high-speed travel across
interstellar distances once thought impossible.</p>

<p>The invention of the quantum drive and quick adoption was regarded as a pivotal cause for the
<a href="Solstice_War">Solstice War</a>.</p>

<h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>
<p>While nominal (normal) space consists of only 3 spatial dimensions, an additional 8 can be
found within hyperspace. Because of the additional spatial dimensions, hyperspace geometry may
result in a route through hyperspace that is shorter than an equivalent route in nominal space,
between the same two points.</p>

<p>In other words, two points in nominal space <sr>A</sr> and <sr>B</sr> may be <sr>x</sr> distance
from each other. Instead of travelling through nominal space, a spacecraft may “slip” into
hyperdrive, where the distance between <sr>A</sr> and <sr>B</sr> may be less than <sr>x</sr>. This
then results in the journey taking much less time than would be possible in nominal space,
which would effectively have made the journey speed faster than light.</p>

<h2 id="comparison-to-the-warp-drive">Comparison to the warp drive</h2>
<p>The most notable difference between the <a href="Warp_drive">warp drive</a> and the quantum drive is
that the quantum drive is not actually a propulsion mechanism, instead only facilitating the transit
between nominal space and hyperspace. A spacecraft will still require some other form of more
conventional transport, such as a <a href="Casimir_drive">casimir drive</a>.</p>

<p>Even early in the adoption of the quantum drive, journeys through hyperspace were found to be even
faster than those with the older warp drive system. Because the quantum drive is not a propulsion
system, however, a spacecraft can engage its warp drive within hyperspace, cutting down travel time
even more.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>As the quantum drive travel requires transit through hyperspace, scattered pockets of
<a href="Antimatter">antimatter</a> pose a threat to any craft that may come into contact in hyperspace.
Hyperspace can be charted and monitored, however areas of lower traffic or uncharted space may be
much riskier for quantum drive vehicles. Thus, exploration of uncharted space must be done with
much slower warp drives, limiting the speed as to how many new systems can be charted and examined
in detail.</p>
