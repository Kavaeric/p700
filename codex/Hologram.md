A **hologram** is a category of quantum technologies that are designed to project energy - be it
kinetic or electromagnetic - an arbitrary distance from the emission's actual source through the use
of precise quantum tunneling. It is one of the most versatile technologies known to science,
employed in a great number of domestic, industrial, commercial, or military applications.

While hologram technology was likely speculated long before Terrans entered space, the idea did not
materialise until sometime during the [Solstice War](Solstice_War.html), although it is unclear as
to when exactly the technology was first developed, let alone who should be credited.

## Holographics
**Holographics** refer specifically to hologram technology used modify or produce light in space.

### Additive holographics
The simplest and oldest form of hologram technology, **additive holographics** tunnel photons through
from an emitter out to a point in space. Multiple locations can be scanned through in rapid succession,
producing what appears to be a three-dimensional image floating in mid-air.

### Backdrop holographics
**Backdrop holographics** block, diffuse light, or do both. They are very often combined with
additive holographics, allowing their use against a bright background.

## Holotactiles
**Holotactiles** refer to the use of hologram technology to project reaction forces against an
applied kinetic force.
