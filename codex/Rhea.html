<p><strong>Rhea</strong> is <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>’s second largest moon, and its most populated. A moon homogeneously
composed of water ice and silica, <a href="Terran_Federation">Terrans</a> have been enclosing portions of its
surface and terraforming the interior of the enclosures. Approximately one-quarter of the planet’s
surface has been developed in such a manner. Rhea is the <a href="Sol_system">Sol system</a>’s third-most populated
single world, after <a href="Luna">Luna</a> and <a href="Earth">Earth</a>.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Rhea was settled by Terrans in 103, after the initial settlement of <a href="Titan">Titan</a>. Rhea’s considerably
small size had made Terrans hesitant to colonise the moon, and development was limited for over a
century. In the early 200s century,  <a href="Subscale_inertial_control">subscale inertial control</a> allowed
for artificial gravity on lower gravity worlds, increasing desirability and reducing health risks
associated with low gravity. However, Rhea’s lack of resources or subsurface ocean meant Saturn’s
other moons were prioritised over it.</p>

<p>Circumstances regarding Rhea would soon shift dramatically: The emergence of the <a href="Antimatter">antimatter</a>
economy as well as <a href="Carbon_materials">carbon materials</a> made the sectioned terraforming of worlds feasible.
Of Saturn’s moons, Rhea was chosen given its size and relatively little development to disturb during
construction of these habitats. The <a href="Solstice_War">Solstice War</a>, however, would stem this development
for some time.</p>

<p>In the waning years of the, interest in terraforming Rhea had re-emerged from the newly-established
<a href="Terran_Federation">Terran Federation</a> as part of its <a href="Post-War_Initiatives_Programme">Post-War Initiatives Programme</a>.
Rhea was regarded as a prime candidate for terraforming in an effort to stabilise the economy of the
outer Solar system. By the mid 500s century, large swathes of Rhea had been terraformed, with expansions
planned and underway.</p>

<p>In 611, during surveying for a terraformed habitat expansion, a <a href="Nesse_Piano_Mystery">Nesse Piano</a>
was found half-buried in a crater on Rhea’s south pole.</p>

<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p>Rhea is a heavily cratered moon primarily composed of a mix of water ice and silica. Aside from changes
in density based on depth, Rhea is very homogenous, with no easily defined lithosphere, mantle, and
core.</p>

<h2 id="habitation">Habitation</h2>
<p>The vast majority of Rhea’s population live within its enclosed habitats, known as wards. These wards
are enormous superstructures that cover whole regions of the moon, and are dug and recessed into the
moon’s surface, with excavated materials used to construct the habitat itself or exported. Laminated
synthetic diamond covers the excavated portion, and the interior of the ward is terraformed to resemble
<a href="Earth">Earth</a>. To accommodate for the Rhean day and night cycle, which lasts for over 100 hours, the
clear transparent roof can dim or brighten to help compensate for difficulties with the circadian
rhythm. Buildings, however, still adhere to a strict code regarding lighting regulations.</p>

<p>Within the wards, many opt to live in large city centres complete with <a href="Demiarcology">demiarcologies</a>,
as per Terran norm, although a hefty proportion have opted to live out in the Rhean countryside. Rhea
is a popular location for offworld residents to set up a seasonal
retreat.</p>

<p>Although the wards are carefully climate controlled, they can be regarded as chilly, almost subarctic
by <a href="Earth">Terrene</a> standards. Temperatures hover between approximately 10 to 20 degrees during the
daylight portion of the Rhean day, and can drop to as low as -12 during the night.</p>

<p>Outside the open terraformed wards, residents typically live under the Rhean surface. These colonies
are often found near <a href="Spacecraft">spacecraft</a> construction facilities.</p>

<h2 id="society">Society</h2>
<p>Rhean attitudes can vary wildly, from general naivety and aloofness, to one that enjoys leading simple
lives, although those attitudes tend to be skewed between the urban centres and rural sprawl
respectively. A sizeable portion of Rheans tend to describe themselves as Rhean or Saturnian first,
and Terran second.</p>

<p>Rheans highly value their cuisine culture, typically a mix of vegetables and seafood from the moon’s
lakes or from aquafarms elsewhere in the Saturnian system. Cuisine is a strong highlight of Rhean
customs, one that is double-edged: Expect your Rhean hosts to always ensure you are well-fed, but
are unusually strict when it comes to restaurant service or even quality of your cooking.</p>

<p>Rheans typically align towards <a href="Social_Democratic_Party">Social Democratic</a> politics.
<a href="New_Federalist">Democratic confederalist</a> and <a href="Social_Market_Party">mutualist</a> politics gain more
modest support on Rhea.</p>

<h2 id="economy">Economy</h2>
<p>The Rhean economy is mixed, mostly propped up by its service sector as well as the management of
gas mining activities on Saturn. The low gravity and proximity of fuel make Rhea a popular stop in
the Sol system for travelling aethercraft, as well as being an aethercraft manufacturing hub itself.
Thanks to its terraformed wards, the Rhean economy sees much income from agriculture and aquaculture,
as well as craftspeople eager to take advantage of the local exotic materials. Tourism is also a popular
business on Rhea, given the moon’s unique social atmosphere as well as picturesque scenery of its
Earthlike terraformed regions superimposed over a sky dominated by Saturn.</p>
