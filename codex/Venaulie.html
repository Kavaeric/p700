</div>

<p>The <strong>venaulie</strong> is a <a href="Vilous_Republic.html">Vilousian</a> musical instrument, played by cranking a
spinning wheel that, in turn, vibrates three strings, in a similar manner to an old <a href="Terran_Federation.html">Terran</a>
hurdy-gurdy. By pressing keys on a keyboard, tangent levers are in turn pressed against the strings,
which then adjust the pitch of the played notes. The exemption was the lowest string, known as the
drone, which would not be affected by the tangent levers and was usually tuned to the root note
of a chord.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The Vilousian venaulie originated from north <a href="Tal.html">Tal</a>, in what would become part of modern
<a href="Shigu_Kingdom.html">Shigu</a> territory, where it was initially a two-storey-tall installment in villages
used to either communicate across longer distances or as a siren for danger, or to scare away hostile
<a href="Talyxian.html">talyxian</a> wildlife. Its size and cost, however, with its difficulty of use, limited
the widespread use of this old “village-style” variant.</p>

<p>Downsized variants began appearing across ancient Shigu, in a form factor small enough to be transported
and played by a single person. It was favoured for its relative simplicity to play and unique sound,
and quickly spread south into <a href="Gold_Ring.html">Gold Ring</a> where it was propelled to fame and universal
popularity.</p>

<p>The versatility of the instrument continued to be iterated upon, with the addition of a handle that
can either be cranked normally or spun with the full hand. The drone string also can be doubled or
even tripled up to give a fuller sound.</p>

<p>The venaulie has maintained dominance in Vilousian music culture over the centuries, and the
introduction of the Vilous civilisation to the galactic stage has only cemented its iconic status.</p>

<h2 id="variants">Variants</h2>
<p>The venaulie is split into two main categories: The more traditionally-styled and more popular
northern variant, as well as the lighter and cheaper southern variant. Modern electrified and <a href="Synth.html">synth</a>
versions have also entered production in limited numbers.</p>

</div>

<p>The northern venaulie is the variant closest to its original design, and is nowadays the most common.
Northern venaulies were originally made of easy-to-source talyxian woodstock, but this was later
replaced with more luxurious and higher quality <a href="Eltus.html">eltus</a> wood. Lately, imported Terran or
<a href="Ikamo_Federation.html">Ikamo</a> wood has been gaining popularity as a construction material.</p>

<h3 id="southern-venaulie">Southern venaulie</h3>
<p>The southern venaulie variant arose from Gold Ring, after widespread demand for a more accessible,
cheaper variant of the instrument. While the southern venaulie generally did not maintain as nice
acoustics as its northern counterpart, nor its versatility or construction quality, its design was
more affordable to the average Gold Ring commoner, made possible through the removal of decorative
elements, simplified form, and removal of certain features such as the adjustable playboard.</p>

</div>

<p>The southern venaulie gradually declined in popularity as manufacturing methods allowed the more
favoured northern variant to be made cheaper and in larger numbers, especially after the Shigu
Expansionist war. The southern venaulie, however, continues to remain popular, especially with
larger ensembles, novices, or younger players.</p>
