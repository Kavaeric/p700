            <h1>Antimatter</h1>
            <p><strong>Antimatter</strong> (colloquially referred to as “amat”) is a material composed of antiparticles,
particles that have the same mass as particles in normal matter but with opposite properties. Should
antimatter and matter come into contact, the equivalent mass of both kinds of matter is annihilated
directly into energy.</p>

<p>Presently, antimatter is the most potent source of energy known to science. Through the equation <sr>E = mc<sup>2</sup></sr>, with:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>E</strong> being energy in joules;</li>
  <li><strong>m</strong> being total mass of normal and antimatter in kilograms;</li>
  <li><strong>c</strong> being the speed of light constant in metres per second;</li>
</ul>

<p>it is possible to calculate that 1 gram of antimatter annihilating with 1 gram of normal matter
yields approximately 1.798 × 10<sup>14</sup> joules of energy, roughly comparable to the yield
of a nuclear fission bomb.</p>

<p>Antimatter is exceptionally scarce in nominal space, however can be found in plentiful quantities
in <a href="Hyperspace.html">hyperspace</a>. Free antimatter exists in hyperspace as isolated,
negatively-charged antiprotons, and as positively-charged positrons. Prevailing theories propose
that the strong force may be weaker in hyperspace, disallowing the formation of atoms, although
there is still some debate within the scientific community.</p>

<h2 id="trawling">Trawling</h2>

    </a>
    

</div>

<p>Antimatter trawling is the process of gathering antimatter from hyperspace by using strong magnetic
fields.</p>

<p>In order to access hyperspace, antimatter trawlers are fitted with <a href="Quantum_drive.html">quantum drives</a>
to be able to transit between it and nominal space. There, a trawler’s magnetic field can be used to
channel antimatter in for encasement. It is important to know that too dense an antimatter field can
overwhelm a trawler’s shields and magnetic field.</p>

<p>Antimatter is an extremely popular energy source, thus antimatter trawling is an enormous business.
Trawling organisations often organise themselves their operations by planning routes along
hyperspace routes, with hyperspace “runs” between individual systems.</p>

<p>As more antimatter can be collected on longer runs and journeys, a remote colony can attract
trawlers looking for rest before making the next leg of their journey. Organisations can use their
trawlers to deliver regular supplies to these colonies. In return, the colony can offer economical
rates for ship servicing and hospitality for crew, forming a cooperative relationship between
antimatter trawling organisations and remote colonies, both easing the logistics of antimatter
trawling as well as providing business to distant worlds with otherwise little traffic.</p>

<h2 id="encasement">Encasement</h2>
<p>Storing antimatter is a process known as encasement, and encased antimatter is known as antimatter
fuel. The term “refined antimatter” is sometimes used, albeit inaccurate as the antimatter is not
actually purified or separated into component parts.</p>

<p>Antimatter fuel is stored in standardised antimatter caskets for transport; these caskets can be
re-used once empty.</p>

<h3 id="antiproton-fullerenisation">Antiproton fullerenisation</h3>
<p>Antiprotons can be stored via fullerenisation, where they are encased in spherically structured
carbon molecules, known as fullerenes. The negative charge of the antiproton repels it from the
electrons of the fullerene, preventing the two from coming into contact. This results in an
extremely stable system that can even withstand significant impact forces.</p>

    </a>

</div>

<p>Antiproton fuel appears as an extremely fine black powder, though the powder can be bound into
blocks or even dissolved in a liquid solvent. Refinement and removal of empty fullerenes can further
increase energy storage efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="positron-trapping">Positron trapping</h3>
<p>Positrons cannot be stored in the same way as antiprotons, as they are positively charged and
therefore be attracted to the electron shells of regular matter.</p>

<div class="fancybox_container right">
    <a data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="

    </a>
    

</div>

<p>Instead, a containment unit can be built out of graphene, where electrons are forced out of the
individual “sheets”, inducing a positive charge. This results in a system very similar to
fullerenisation, however requires a constant power supply, else the antimatter will come in contact
with regular matter.</p>

<p>Positrons are much more expensive than antiproton fuel due to the increased upkeep for storage and
transport, but also as positron fuel is much more energy dense.</p>
